## My Frontend Project

### General Project Summary

Our project will utilize API's to find gyms based on a user's location and will automatically monitor gym traffic to determine the best times to work out.  Another element of the website will be to pull in a sample workout that someone can follow each time they visit their local gym or build their own custom workout.
